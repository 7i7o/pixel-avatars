# General Notes

* alex245 from discord is willing to pick up the frontend web3 integration (he's skilled w/ vue)
* smart contract is ready to be tested on rinkeby
* question raised on whether we should make a discourse poll to decide on the chain where we want the nfts to be (mainnet / polygon?)
* discussion started regarding ideas for stuff we can build on top of the derivates nft project (games?). carlos expressed interested in this

## Pixel Avatar Deployment

* The source of funding for the deployment of the contract is being asked
    * no clear indiction of where it will be coming from and there was some mention of using gitcoin
* The specifics of deployment was discussed as in whether to do in mainnet or polygon
    * goldzulu suggest that the code be non-agnostic and can be deployed anywhere if needed
    * rasmus suggested the discussion be taken to discourse for votes, goldzulu cautioned that we don't want to open a can of worm that can risk delays on deployment - team agreed to bring to Kempsterrr for thoughts and discussion

## Design (Game Artwork)

* Need to start working on initial graphics and artworks for future game derivatives projects
* Need to think on how to differentiate different unique avatars so that a player can connect to their avatar's representation

## Backend

* The backend solidity work for the pixel avatars minting is completed thanks to etherinsight
* More testing welcomed!

## Frontend

* As there is an eager offer to contribute by Alex, Goldzulu mentioned that it is ok to have multiple versions of the front end minting in favor for learning on different ways of skinning the cat

* Alex will proceed to come out with a version that is not using Moralis as that can be done pretty quickly

* Goldzulu will continue to work on a Moralis frontend minting version for strategic reasons:
    * being able to use different blockchain easily going forward including EVM based as well as non EVM based
    * wallet connect integration
    * future collaborations with Moralis
    * easy expansion

## Closing And Future Plan

* The was some confusion with the timing because of daylight savings and it was proposed that another meeting specifically on games be conducted before the next regular meeting
* We need more game developers now!
