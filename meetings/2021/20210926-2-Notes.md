# Notes

## General

* Contributions to projects and achievments can be found in the github repo [status](../STATUS.md) under week ending 26th Sep 2021
* The specificics of public minting was discussed. In particularly;

    * Doing a claimable drop to Genesis NFT holders in the ratio of 1 to 1 -non transferable and/or releasing an extra 1 that are "headless" and not tied to it's genesis NFT and can be transferred or sold as a liquidity reward to genesis token holder

    * Mint extra 1000-3000 NFTs beyond id 8000 as a sale to the public

* It was brought to the attention that there are a few genesis holders that have multiple genesis NFT tokens and this would need to be addressed for any future minting

* Eknobl raised concerns that minting out public NFTs will devalue the DAO Genesis NFT and suggest keeping NFTs only to DAO Owners

* It was finally decided that more due diligence and discussions is needed, such as the discussions at the DAO level for public minting to happen and hence it was shelved for the purpose of current meeting

## Design

* A question of whether there need to be Male or Female version of the avatars was raised. Consensus was reached to make it gender agnostic

## Backend

* The backend solidity work is more or less done with further work needed depending on how the the metadata and image sources are finally rendered

* Gender specific avatars was deemed to add too much complexity to the backend end hence  the approach of gender agnostic avatars

## Frontend

* The frontend team traded collaboration instructions during the meeting in terms of specific formats

    * both SVGs and PNGs will be generated to allow freedom of frontend/backend implementation

    * going forward the avatars will be gender agnostic

## Closing And Future Plan

* General vibe is great and believe that a lot have been achieved in the past two weeks

* It is targetted to get to a demoable version minting test version of the pixel avatars at the end of this two weeks cycle
